Subject: [PATCH] Fix build issues

The main motivation is represented by the compilation error " incompatible
types when assigning to type ‘pthread_t {aka struct }’ from type ‘int’ " caused
by the assumption that type pthread_t is an integer type.
Since this field is never again referenced on top of this assumption,
no purpose could be deduced and, therefore, no equivalent code sequence
taking into account the actual pthread_t's structure could be found.
It is probably worth mentioning that the platform-dependent code -
guarded by #ifdef ENV_BEOS - references multiple times the thread id
on top of the assumption that it is of type integer, leading to believe
that although the assignment had a purpose, it may not be the case on all platforms.
